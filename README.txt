# Random Dungeon and Dragons Mission Generator

This project is a random message generator that generates a new Dungeons and Dragons-inspired "mission" each time it is run. The mission includes a randomly selected race, class, location, and objective.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to practice JavaScript syntax and utilize arrays and functions to create a fun and interactive application. The application generates a random mission by selecting a random element from each of the following arrays: `heroRace`, `heroClass`, `missionSetting`, and `missionGoal`. The selected elements are then displayed to the user.
